## This Workgroup Meeting

<h3> 1\. Some general comments on Assignment report </h3>
<h3> 2\. Work on Assignment 1: Exploratory analysis </h3>


## General comments for Assignment 1

<h3> based on practicals: </h3>

<br>

<h3> - Annotate code </h3>
<h3> - Write text to explain your steps </h3>
<h3> - Explain variables clearly (in text) </h3>
<h3> - Choose what to include <br> <tab> \> Use *head()*, *warnings=FALSE*, make tables </h3>
<h3> - Style plots, tables, text </h3>

## Assignment 1

<h4>You perform a multiple linear regression analysis in R and report this using R markdown. The assignment will be graded on the following elements:</h4><br>

-	<b>Context:</b> Introduction of your research questions, description and potential processing of your data. (Week 1 & 2) 
- <b>Exploratory data analysis:</b> Inspection of potential interesting relations in the data. (Week 3)
-	<b>Linear regression:</b> Description of the building process, the model fit, and the model comparison procedure. (Week 4)
-	<b>Assumptions:</b> Testing of model assumptions, checking for outliers and influential cases. Act upon and reflect on violations when needed. (Week 5)
-	<b>Interpretation:</b> Substantive interpretation of the final model. Answers to your research questions. (Week 5)
-	<b>Layout:</b> Structure of the document, output is efficiently presented, custom functions are developed when needed. Graphs are used where fitting. (Week 3)
