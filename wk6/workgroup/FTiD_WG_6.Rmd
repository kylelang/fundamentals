## This Workgroup Meeting

<h3>1\. Explanation Assignment 2 </h3>
<h3>2\. Start Assignment 2 </h3>

## Assignment 2

<h4>For this assignment, you perform a multiple logistic regression analysis in R and report this using R markdown. </h4>

<br><br>
<h4> - Same groups as Assignment 1</h4>
<h4> - 25% of final course grade </h4>
<h4> - <b>Deadline: Thursday 18th of January, 17:00 </b></h4>

## Assignment 2 - Grading

<h4> In grading this assignment, the following aspects will be considered: </h4><br>

-	<b>Exploratory data analysis:</b> Introduction of your research questions, description and potential processing of your data.
-	<b>Logistic regression:</b> Description of the model fit and model comparison procedure.
-	<b>Assumptions:</b> Testing of model assumptions, checking for outliers and influential cases. Act upon and/or reflect on violations when needed.
-	<b>Interpretation:</b> Substantive interpretation of the final model, including confusion matrix. Answer to your research question.
-	<b>Layout:</b> Structure of the document, output if efficiently presented, custom functions are developed when needed. Graphs are presented where suitable. 

## Assignment 2 - This Meeting

<h4> Start on introduction, adjust research questions </h4>

- Large parts from Assignment 1 can be reused
- However, be critical on what to reuse and what not!

<br>

<h4> Start building a logistic model </h4>

- Same steps as for linear regression
- New model comparison measures
