# Course Goals


## Real-World Goal

We will learn to use regression: a technique for figuring out the strength of 
the relation between an outcome and a set of predictors. 

Basically, our findings will fall into one of the following three scenarios:
```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame(x = 1:10) %>%
  mutate("positive" = x, 
         "negative" = rev(x), 
         "no relation" = 5.5) %>%
  melt(id = "x") %>%
  mutate("relation" = variable) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = value, color = relation)) + 
  ylab("Outcome") + 
  xlab("Predictor") + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Example

```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed(235711)
data <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n = 100, 
                         mean = c(20, 5.8), 
                         sigma = matrix(c(1, .8, .8, 1), 
                                        nrow = 2, 
                                        ncol = 2)
                         ) %>% as.data.frame()
colnames(data) <- c("Hours", "Grade")

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Hours, y = Grade)) + 
  geom_point()
```

On average, the more hours you study, the higher your grade, but this relation 
is not perfect.


## What is the relation?

```{r echo = FALSE}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Hours, y = Grade)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  ggtitle("Grade ~ Hours")
```

We will learn to identify the average relation between the outcome and the 
predictors. 


## Who passed?

```{r echo = FALSE}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(Result = cut(Grade, 
                      breaks = c(0, 5.5, Inf), 
                      labels = c("failed", "passed")
                      )
         )
  
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Hours, y = Grade, color = Result)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  ggtitle("Grade ~ Hours + pass/fail")
```

We will learn to differentiate our investigation between different groups. For 
example, is there a difference in the relation between `Hours` and `Grade` for 
students who passed and those who failed?


## Who passed?

```{r echo = FALSE}
data %>% 
  mutate(Prob = predict(glm(Result ~ Hours, family = binomial()), 
                        type = "response")
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Hours, y = Prob)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Probability of Passing the Exam") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Hours, y = as.numeric(Result) - 1, color = Result))
```

Finally, we will learn how to estimate the probability of `passing` or `failing`, 
based on the number of `Hours` studied.


## Example

```{r echo = FALSE}
boys %>% 
  filter(age > 5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = bmi)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

What is the relation between `age` and `bmi`?


## Example

```{r echo = FALSE}
boys %>% 
  mutate(class = cut(bmi, 
                     breaks = c(0, 18, 25, 30, Inf), 
                     labels = c("underweight", 
                                "healthy", 
                                "overweight", 
                                "obese")
                     )
         ) %>%
  filter(age > 5, !is.na(bmi)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = bmi, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Can we estimate the relation between `age` and `bmi` for different levels of 
`bmi`?


## Example

```{r echo = FALSE}
boys %>% 
  filter(age > 5, !is.na(bmi)) %>%
  mutate(class = cut(bmi, breaks = c(0, 25, Inf), 
                     labels = c("not overweight", "overweight")),
         Prob = predict(glm(class ~ age, family = binomial(link = "logit")), 
                        type = "response")
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = Prob)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Probability of being overweight") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = age, y = as.numeric(class) - 1, color = class))
```

Finally, if we develop some intervention campaign, which `age`-group(s) should 
we target?


# R and RStudio?


## R

R is a programming/scripting language for statistical computing and graphics

- 100% free and open-source
- Managed by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing
- Community-driven
   - R benefits from a global development community

- Based on the S language
   - S was developed by John Chambers and colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1970s
   - R is an implementation of S
   - The R project was initiated by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the 1990s


## RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

- Adds a bunch of window dressing to R
- Also open-source
- Both free and paid versions


# Working with R


## Using R as a Calculator

You are perfectly free to use R as an overpowered calculator.

- Try typing the following expressions into the R Console

```{r}
2 + 2
sqrt(2)
(42 - 58 + log(7)^(59.33 / 10.784)) / 777
```


## Assigning Values to Objects

R comes into its own when we create objects and do our calculations in terms of 
those objects.

```{r}
a <- 100
b <- 10

c <- sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
c

data(iris)

lmFit <- lm(Petal.Width ~ Petal.Length*Species, data = iris)
beta  <- coef(lmFit)

beta["Petal.Length"] + beta["Petal.Length:Speciesversicolor"]
```


## Getting Help
Everything published on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and intended 
for R users, must be accompanied by a help file. 

- If you know the name of the function (e.g., `anova()`), then execute `?anova` 
or `help(anova)`. 

- If you do not know the name of the function, type `??` followed by your search 
criterion. For example, `??anova` returns a list of all help pages that contain 
the word "anova". 

Alternatively, the internet will tell you almost everything you'd like to know

- Sites such as http://www.stackoverflow.com and http://www.stackexchange.com 
can be very helpful. 

- If you google R-related issues, include "R" somewhere in your search string


## Survey

We (the instructors) have prepared a survey to help us arrange the workgroups 
more effectively.

- You can access the survey [here](https://survey.uu.nl/jfe/form/SV_8jJ7r9p7Zkyx130).
- You can also access the survey by scanning the following QR code.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "30%"}
  knitr::include_graphics("../figures/survey_qr.png")
```

<div align = "center">

# Types of R Objects


## Vectors

Vectors are the simplest kind of R object
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a

b <- 1:5
b

c <- 42
c
```


## The Three Most Useful Data Types

Numeric
```{r}
a <- 1:5
a
```

Character
```{r}
b <- c("foo", "bar")
b
```

Logical
```{r}
c <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
c
```


## Combining Data Types in Vectors
What happens if we try to concatenate different data types? 
```{r}
c(a, b)
c(b, c)
c(a, c)
```


## Subsetting Vectors

If we want to extract the third element from `a`, we would evaluate
```{r}
a[3]
```

To get the first two elements:
```{r}
a[1:2]
```

To get the second and fifth elements:
```{r}
a[c(2, 5)]
```


## Matrices

Matrices generalize vectors by adding a dimension attribute
```{r}
c <- matrix(a, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
c
```

```{r}
matrix(a, nrow = 5, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
```


## Subsetting Matrices

As with vectors, we use brackets [] to subset matrices.

- Extract the intersection of the first row and second column:
```{r}
c[1, 2]
```


## Subsetting Matrices

Extract the first row:
```{r}
c[1, ]
```

Extract the second column:
```{r}
c[, 2]
```
 

## Mixing Data Types in Matrices

```{r}
cbind(c, letters[1:5])
cbind(c, c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
```


## Data Frames
```{r}
n <- 5
d <- data.frame("v1" = rnorm(n),
                "v2" = rnorm(n, mean = 5.0, sd = 2.0), 
                "v3" = letters[1:n],
                "v4" = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), n, replace = TRUE)
                )
d
```

The columns of a data frame can contain different data types. 


## Names

You can name the columns and rows in data frames and matrices
```{r}
rownames(d) <- c("r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5")
d

colnames(c) <- paste0("var", 1 : ncol(c))
rownames(c) <- paste0("obs", 1 : nrow(c))
c
```


## Names

You can also name the elements in a vector:

```{r}
names(a) <- paste("element", 1 : length(a), sep = "_")
a

names(b) <- c("Bobby", "Suzy")
b
```


## Subsetting Data Frames

We can also use the brackets to subset data frames

- We can use names, when they exist
```{r}
d["r3", ]
```

- We can also use numeric indices
```{r}
d[3, ]
```

```{r}
d[2, 3]
```


## Subsetting Data Frames

To extract columns, we can use matrix-style subsetting
```{r}
d[, "v2"]
d[, 2]
```

We can also use the `$` operator to extract variables by name
```{r}
d$v2
```


## Lists

Lists are very general objects. They hold any types of R objects.

- You can mix and match whatever objects you want in the same list.

```{r}
f <- list(b, c)
f
```


## Lists

We can add names to the list elements
```{r}
names(f) <- c("vector", "matrix")
f
```


## Subsetting Lists

We have several different ways to extract the objects from a list
```{r}
f[[1]]
f[["vector"]]
f$vector
```


## Lists

We can easily add an object to an existing list
```{r}
f$data_frame <- d
f
```


## Lists

We can overwrite an object in a list
```{r}
f[[2]] <- c * 2
f
```


## Lists of Lists

Lists can hold any type of object, so they can also contain other lists.
```{r}
g <- list(f, f)
```

Call the vector from the second list within g:
```{r}
g[[2]][[1]]
g[[2]]$vector
```


# Logical Operations


## Logical Operators

Logical operators evaluate a statement and produce a logical vector

- The most common logical operators are `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `|` (OR), `&` (AND)
- Typing `!` before a logical expression inverts the result 

For example, select the elements of `c` that are larger than 3:
```{r}
c[c > 3]
```


## Logical Operators

Select the elements of `c` that are smaller than 3 OR larger than 3:
```{r}
c[c < 3 | c > 3] # c smaller than 3 or c larger than 3
```

Alternatively:
```{r}
c[c != 3] # c not equal to 3
```

Also alternatively:
```{r}
c[!(c == 3)] # not c equal to 3
```


# Computational Considerations


## Things You Cannot Do

R cannot do everything you may ask it to

- You cannot break math
   - For example, the following code returns "Not a Number"
```{r}
0 / 0
```

- You also cannot calculate with missing values (`NA`s)
```{r}
mean(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5))
```


## Standard "Solutions" for Missing Values

There are two easy ways to perform "listwise deletion":
```{r}
mean(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE)
mean(na.omit(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)))
```


## Floating-Point Example

Be careful with floating-point arithmetic
```{r}
(3 - 2.9)
(3 - 2.9) == 0.1
```

Why does R tell us that $3 - 2.9 \neq 0.1$?

```{r}
(3 - 2.9) - 0.1
```


# Upping your R Game


## Functions

In R, a name followed directly by parentheses, `()`, always indicates a 
functions. For example:

 - `matrix()` is a function
 - `c()` is a function
 - `(1 - 2) * 5` is an expression, not a function


## Packages

Packages give R additional functionality. 

By default, some packages are included when you install R. These packages allow 
you to do common statistical analyses and data manipulation. Installing 
additional packages allows you to perform state-of-the-art statistical analyses. 

These packages are all developed by R users, so the throughput process is very 
timely.

  - Newly developed functions and software are readily available
  - Software implementations of new methods can be quickly dissemintated
  - This efficiency differs from other mainstream software (e.g., SPSS, SAS, 
  MPlus) where new methodology may take years to be implemented. 

A list of available packages can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)


## Installing and Loading packages

Install a package (e.g., `mice`):
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mice")
```

There are two ways to load a package into R
```{r}
library(stats)
require(stats)
```


## Workspaces

The workspace contains all changes you have made during your current R session. 

- The workspace contains a snapshot of R's current working memory allocation. 

If you load a saved workspace, you do not need to rerun all your code again. 

- You can save the workspace and continue exactly where you left.

Workspaces are compressed and require relatively little memory when stored. 

- The compression is very efficient and beats reloading large datasets.


## History

R saves (part of) the code history, and RStudio extends this functionality. 

- You can use the history to call up previously evaluated commands.

There are multiple ways to access the code history.
  
1. Hit the "up-arrow" key in the console
   - Cycle back through previous commands in reverse chronological sequence

2. Use the history tab in the RStudio environment pane. 
   - You can find and search the complete project history. 

    
## RStudio Projects

RStudio projects provide a convenient way to organize all of the code and 
supporting resources for a given research project.

- Every project has its own history
- Every research project can have its own RStudio project
- Every project can have its own directory
- Every project can have its own version control system
- R-studio projects can relate to GitHub (or other online) repositories


## Some Programming Tips

- Keep your code tidy

- Use comments (text preceded by `#`) to clarify what you are doing

- When working with functions in RStudio, use the TAB key to quickly access the 
documentation of the function's arguments

- Give your R scripts logical names

- Work with RStudio projects or a consistent directory structure

- If allowed, place your project directories somewhere in the cloud


## General Style Advice

Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT.

- Browse through the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org)

  - The point of style guidelines is to enforce a common vocabulary 
  - You want people to concentrate on *what* you're saying, not *how* you're 
  saying it. 

- If the code you add looks drastically different from the extant code, the 
incongruity will confuse readers and collaborators.

Spacing makes your code easier to read and understand

  - `a<-c(1,2,3,4,5)`
  - `a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
  - At least put spaces around assignment operators and after every comma!
