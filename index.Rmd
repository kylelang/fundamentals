# Quick Overview

## Column 1 {data-width=400}

### 

In nine weeks, you will learn the basics of data handling with R and details 
about regression techniques in the context of statistical inference. We will 
also cover the connection between these concepts and research philosophy. During 
every lecture, we will cover a different theoretical topic. In addition to the 
lectures, there will also be a weekly computer lab exercise that connects the 
statistical theory to practice. You will also attend weekly workgroup meetings 
wherein you will work on solving motivating, real-world case studies. 

### Assignment and Grading

The final grade is computed as follows

| Grade Component | Weight |
|:-------|:------|
| Group assignment 1: Linear regression | 25% |
| Group assignment 2: Logistic Regression | 25% |
| Written Exam | 50% |

In addition to the grade components listed above, you will also do `R` exercises 
for the first 7 weeks of the course. These exercises will develop the skills 
needed to successfully complete the assignments. 

To pass the course:

1. Your final exam grade must be 5.5 or higher
1. Both of your assignments grades must be 5.5 or higher

### Literature

We will use two open-source books in this course:

1. [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS) 
   - You can find solutions for the R4DS exercises
   [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).
1. [*Applied Statistics with R*](https://book.stat420.org) (ASWR)

There is no need to purchase these books. The freely available online versions 
are sufficient. The relevant chapters will be linked in this dashboard where the 
reading is assigned. We will also use several external webpages and web apps. 
These resources will also be linked in this dashboard.

# Course Manual

## Column 1 {data-width=400}

### Course Content

Regression techniques are widely used to quantify the relationship between two 
or more variables. In data science, linear and logistic regression are common 
and powerful techniques for evaluating such relations. These techniques are only 
useful, however, once you understand when and how to apply them. In this course, 
students will learn how to apply linear and logistic regression with the `R` 
statistical software package.
 
This course will introduce students to the principles of analytical data science, 
linear and logistic regression, and the basics of statistical learning. Students
will develop fundamental `R` programming skills and will gain experience with 
tidyverse: visualize data with ggplot2 and performing basic data wrangling with 
dplyr. This course helps prepare students for an entry-level research career 
(e.g. junior researcher or research assistant) or further education in research 
(e.g., a [research] Master program or a PhD).


### Course goals

At the end of this course, students are able to:

1. Identify key statistical concepts such as:
    *	(Conditional) probability
    *	Inference
    * Estimation
    *	Prediction
    *	Classification
    *	Sampling variability
    *	Statistical modeling
    *	Residuals
    *	Fitted values
$\vb$
1. Choose an appropriate regression model for a given research scenario.
$\vb$
1. Explain the differences/similarities between statistical inference and 
model-based prediction/classification; give examples of each type of problem.
$\vb$
1. Identify the assumptions of linear and logistic regression; describe the 
consequences of violating these assumptions.
$\vb$
1. Describe the three components of a generalized linear model and how these 
components are specified in logistic regression.
$\vb$
1. Interpret the estimates from linear and logistic regression models, and use 
these estimates to answer research questions.
$\vb$
1. Use the `R` statistical software platform to perform basic statistical 
programming, data manipulation, data visualization, and basic data wrangling.
$\vb$
1. Use the `R` statistical software platform to perform, interpret, and evaluate 
linear and logistic regression analyses on real-world data.
$\vb$
1. Interpret `R` output and use the results to answer research questions.
$\vb$
1. Use `R` Markdown to document the results of a statistical analysis.

### Relation between assessment and objective 

In this course, skills and knowledge are evaluated with two types of assignment.

1. The exam evaluates knowledge and understanding of statistical concepts 
(Learning goal 1), the ability to critically evaluate research problems and 
statistical methods (Learning goals 2–5), and the ability to interpret 
statistical results and software output and apply these interpretations 
(Learning goals 6 & 9).
$\vb$
1. The group assignments evaluate the student’s ability to work with data, solve 
basic data analytic problems, execute quantitative data analyses on real-world 
data sets, and document the results (learning goals 6–10).

### Course structure 

In eight weeks, you will learn the basics of data handling and statistical 
programming with R and details about regression techniques in the context of 
statistical inference, prediction, and classification. Each week will comprise 
three class activities:

1. During the weekly lectures, we will cover the theoretical content.
$\vb$
1. Weekly practical exercises connect the statistical theory to practice by 
applying the lecture content in the R statistical programming language.
$\vb$
1. During the weekly workgroup meetings, you will work on real-world data 
analysis with a group of your peers.

# Preparation

## Column 1

###

This semester, you will participate in the **Fundamental Techniques in Data 
Science with `R`** course at Utrecht University. In this course, you will use 
both `R` and `RStudio`. The steps below will guide you through installing both 
`R` and `RStudio`. Please do so before the first meeting. 

### **System requirements**

Bring a laptop computer to the course, and make sure that you have full write 
access and administrator rights on the machine. We will explore programming and 
compiling in this course, so you will need full access to your machine. Some 
corporate laptops come with limited access for their users, I therefore advise 
you to bring a personal laptop to the workgroup meetings. 

### **1. Install `R`**

You can obtain a copy of `R` [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use 
`R` directly in the course. Rather, we'll call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore, 
you also need to install `RStudio`. 

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**

`RStudio` is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`. You can 
download `RStudio` as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 
The free and open-source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Open `RStudio`, and copy-paste the following lines of code into the console 
window to execute them.

- If nothing happens after you paste the code, try hitting the "Enter/Return" 
key.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", 
                   "tidyverse", 
                   "magrittr", 
                   "micemd", 
                   "jomo", 
                   "pan", 
                   "lme4", 
                   "knitr", 
                   "rmarkdown", 
                   "plotly", 
                   "ggplot2", 
                   "devtools", 
                   "class", 
                   "car", 
                   "MASS", 
                   "ISLR",  
                   "mice"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to paste the code, use the following figure to 
identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="images/console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>

When you are asked the following:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

Type `Yes` in the console, and press the "Enter/Return" key (or click the 
corresponding button if the question presents as a dialog box). 

### **What if the steps do not work for me?**

If the suggested steps fail, or you have insufficient rights on your machine, 
you can use the following web-based solutions. 

1. Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). 

   - You can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there.
$\va$
2. Use Utrecht University's [MyWorkPlace](https://myworkplace.uu.nl/). 

   - You will have access to `R` and `RStudio` there. When you start a new 
   MyWorkPlace session, you may need to (re)install packages. 

Naturally, you will need internet access to use these services. 

## Column 2

### Get acquainted with `R`

To familiarize yourself with basic `R` usage, complete the following 
[exercise](preparation/exercise_prep.html) before the first lecture. This 
exercise will get you started with `R` and `RStudio`.

### Basic statistical concepts

We expect you to be familiar with some basic statistical concepts such as:

* Descriptive statistics
* Sampling
* Correlation
* T-test

# Exam Material

## Column 1

### **Practice Exam**

You can find the practice exam [here](https://kylelang.shinyapps.io/practice_exam)

### **What can be tested?**

Anything mentioned in the lectures may appear on the exam. This includes both 
information printed in the lecture slides and information delivered verbally 
during a lecture itself.

- Although the readings should be helpful for learning/reinforcing the concepts 
covered in the lectures, we will not test you on any concept that appears in 
a reading but was not addressed in the lectures.

### **What about equations?**

This is not a math class; we are not trying to test your ability to do 
calculations or manipulate equations. That being said, a certain degree of 
mathematical literacy is crucial to statistics and data science, so you will 
have to do some simple calculations on the exam. For example, you should be 
comfortable with the following.

- Working with the linear regression equation, $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i +\varepsilon_i$, to:
   - Calculate predicted values give certain inputs
   - Interpret parameter estimates
   - Evaluate hypotheses/research questions

- The differences between:
   - The full regression model: $Y_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i +\hat{\varepsilon}_i$
   - The equation for the best-fit line: $\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i$

- The definition of a residual: 
   - $\hat{\varepsilon}_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$

- The relationship between probabilities ($p$) and odds (for binary outcomes):
   - $\text{odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}$

- The definition of the logit function:
   - $\log(\text{odds}) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \text{logit}(p)$

- The definition of the logistic function, its relation to the logit function, 
and its role in logistic regression:
   - $\text{logistic}(\eta_i) = \text{logit}^{-1}(p_i) = \frac{\exp(\eta_i)}{1+\exp(\eta_i)} = \frac{\exp(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i)}{1 + \exp(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i)} = \hat{p}_i$

Of course, you should also be able to do basic arithmetic operations that are 
too trivial to detail here (e.g., calculating the difference between the $R^2$ 
statistics from two models that you are trying to compare).

**Note**: Although all examples above are shown in terms of simple linear 
regression models, you should also be able to do these calculations/interpretations 
using multiple linear regression models and models that include dummy codes, 
interactions, or polynomial terms.

### **What if you're still unsure?**

If any of the course materials confuse you, feel free to ask about it during the 
lecture or one of the weekly Q&A sessions (even if your concerns relate to 
content from earlier weeks). 

**We will devote part (most?) of the final lecture to a dedicated Q&A session**
